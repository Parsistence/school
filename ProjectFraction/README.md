#Project Description:
Create a class called Fraction.
This class will simulate the four basic mathematical operations with fractions.
Your class should contain two integer instance variables (num, den).
You should have a default constructor that initializes the instance variables as follows: num = 1, den = 2.
You should have a two-parameter constructor that accepts integer parameters to initialize the two instance variables.
Create a static, void method for each: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
These methods are separate from each other.
Each method should print the result of the operation as a fraction (not a decimal)
Finally, test your class in another class called FractionTest.
If you would like to, you can include user input.
